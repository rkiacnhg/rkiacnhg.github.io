[Using One Class VAEs to Analyze Bias in Deepfake Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m44fEsZHE5w&list=PLp-0K3kfddPw0hVKPZa5JJL9fqLn_mUjO&index=24)

In this project, I design and train a One-Class VAE to distinguish Real and Fake Audio from [ASVSpoof 2019](https://www.asvspoof.org/index2019.html), then analyze whether the model is biased towards a gender, in hopes of answering the question, is it easier to generate Deepfake Audio of one gender over another?

[Sequentializing Pytorch's Parallel Implementation of Attention for Transformers](https://github.com/rkiacnhg/sequentializing-attention-pytorch/blob/main/sequentializing_attention.ipynb)
I implemented a Sequential version of Multi-headed Attention for Transformer Models from the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf). 
The comparison shows that a parallelized implementation is preferred when there is sufficient GPU memory available, but a sequential implementation may be better when GPU usage must be conserved.
